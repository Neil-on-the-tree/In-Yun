“In-Yun” (https://qcqd5m.csb.app) is an interactive website designed and developed for the Co-Designing with the Machine course at Chiba University. In this project, I was responsible for generating ideas, determining the visual style, and developing the program.

The task of the Co-Designing with the Machine course is to find a design subject that can be designed with the help of AI models and computer program, and develop it into a complete  project. 

In this project, we chose to delve into a topic from the film ‘Past Lives,’ which explores love, fate, and chance. We aim to use AI technology and computer programs to create a visual simulation of this intriguing subject.
